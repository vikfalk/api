# ForestVision üõ∞Ô∏è

ForestVision is a web-based tool designed to analyze deforestation over a specified period using satellite imagery. This application allows users to select geographic coordinates and a time frame to visualize changes in forest cover and quantify the extent of deforestation. 

## Features

- **Geographic Selection**: Select any location globally using latitude and longitude inputs.
- **Time Frame Specification**: Define the start and end dates to analyze deforestation within that period.
- **Image Processing**: Retrieve and process satellite images to identify and visualize forest cover changes.
- **Interactive Map**: Display the selected area on an interactive map with an overlay indicating the deforested area.
- **Deforestation Metrics**: Calculate and display key metrics, including the percentage of forest cover loss, total deforested area in hectares, and annual CO2 loss due to deforestation.

## Installation

To run ForestVision locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forestvision.git
    cd forestvision
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit application**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Application**: After running the Streamlit command, a web browser should open with the ForestVision interface. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

2. **Select Location and Time Frame**:
    - **Coordinates**: Input the latitude and longitude for the area of interest.
    - **Time Frame**: Choose the start and end dates for the analysis.

3. **View and Analyze Results**:
    - **View on Map**: Click the "View on map" button to display the selected area on the map.
    - **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to start the image retrieval and processing. The results will include satellite images, forest overlays, and deforestation metrics.

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main application file containing the Streamlit interface and core logic.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- **`smooth_and_vectorize.py`**: Utility script for image processing (if applicable).
- **`example_images/`**: Directory containing example images used in the app.
